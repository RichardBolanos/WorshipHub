## Critical Findings & Root Causes

### 1. NavigationHelper — THE main blocker
**Status:** Unsolved. Both approaches tried, neither works for all pages.

**Approach A: `appRouter.go()` (programmatic)**
- ✅ Works for: songs (7/8), login, registration, profile, categories, notifications
- ❌ Fails for: teams, setlists — `appRouter` is a global singleton that may have stale redirect state between orchestrator test runs
- Root cause: `appRouter` is `final GoRouter` created once at app startup. The orchestrator reinstalls the app between tests, but the Dart isolate may reuse the same `appRouter` instance with cached redirect results.

**Approach B: UI taps on feature cards**
- ❌ Fails for ALL pages — the Home page feature grid is inside a `CustomScrollView` with slivers. Widgets below the fold don't exist in the widget tree until scrolled into view. `find.text('Equipos')` returns 0 results, `ensureVisible` fails, `scrollUntilVisible` fails with slivers.

**Next step:** Try a hybrid: use `appRouter.go()` as default, but for teams/setlists that fail, navigate via Home page by first scrolling the CustomScrollView with `tester.drag()` to reveal the grid, then tapping.

### 2. Orchestrator hangs (affects 3 files)
Calendar (7 tests), chat (4 tests), and cross_feature (4 tests) consistently hang during execution. The Android Test Orchestrator on Windows with Gradle 8.14 has intermittent lock file issues (`utp.0.log.lck`).

**Workaround:** `gradlew --stop` + delete `build/app/outputs/androidTest-results/` before each run. Works ~80% of the time.

**Next step:** Consider splitting large test files into smaller ones (2-3 tests per file) to reduce orchestrator load.

### 3. Invitation tests — `_authToken` null
`registerUniqueAndLogin()` calls `seedHelper.registerChurch()` + `loginViaUI()` but does NOT call `seedHelper.login()`. So `seedHelper._authToken` stays null. When tests then call `seedHelper.sendInvitation()`, it asserts `_authToken != null`.

**Fix identified:** Add `seedHelper.login()` to `registerUniqueAndLogin()`. BUT this caused a regression in song tests (0/8) — possibly because the API login creates a session that conflicts with the subsequent UI login.

**Next step:** Instead of adding `seedHelper.login()` to `registerUniqueAndLogin()`, add it only in the invitation tests that need it (tests 1-3 that use `sendInvitation` after `registerUniqueAndLogin`).

### 4. Error handling tests — assertion at line 175
`GetIt.instance<Dio>()` works (1/4 pass), but 3 tests fail. The `ErrorSimulationInterceptor` may not be intercepting correctly, or the app's error UI doesn't match the expected text.

**Next step:** Run with verbose to identify which 3 tests fail and why.

### 5. Song edit FAB — async role loading (1 test)
`SongDetailPage` shows the edit FAB only after `_loadUserRole()` completes (async SharedPreferences read). The `_waitForEditFab` polling may timeout.

**Next step:** Increase timeout from 10s to 20s.

## Backend Fixes Applied (committed)

1. **NoOpEmailService.kt** — No-op email for H2 profile (`@Profile("h2") @Primary`)
2. **ChurchRegistrationService.kt** — Auto-verify/activate users in H2 profile
3. **application-h2.yml** — Fixed mail username to valid email

## App Fixes Applied (committed)

1. **ConnectionStatusIndicator** — `Stream.periodic` → `Stream.value` (eliminates persistent timer)
2. **LoginPage shimmer** — Removed `controller.repeat()` (eliminates persistent animation)
3. **HomePage shimmer** — Removed `controller.repeat()` (eliminates persistent animation)
4. **WebSocketService** — Added `forTesting()` constructor; test uses `_NoOpWebSocketService`
5. **ConnectivityService** — Test uses `_TestConnectivityService` without periodic timers
6. **WorshipManagerApp** — Added optional `locale` parameter; tests force `Locale('es')`

## Test Infrastructure (committed)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `patrol_base.dart` | `TestEnvironment` — setup/tearDown, `$.pumpWidget` + `$.pump(3s)` |
| `test_app.dart` | Forces `Locale('es')`, no-op WebSocket/Connectivity, in-memory Drift |
| `navigation_helper.dart` | `appRouter.go()` for navigation (needs hybrid fix for teams/setlists) |
| `login_helper.dart` | `loginViaUI()`, `registerUniqueAndLogin()` |
| `form_helper.dart` | `fillField()` with tap-before-enterText pattern |
| `wait_helper.dart` | All waits use `$.pump(Duration)`, never `pumpAndSettle` |
| `assertion_helper.dart` | `expectTextVisible`, `expectSnackBar`, etc. |
| `api_seed_helper.dart` | Direct HTTP to backend for seeding test data |
| `MainActivityTest.java` | Android test runner for Patrol |
| `build.gradle.kts` | PatrolJUnitRunner + Android Test Orchestrator |
| `patrol.yaml` | Patrol CLI config (targets: `integration_test/`) |

## Key Patterns Learned

1. **NEVER use `$.pumpAndSettle()`** — app has persistent timers (animations, connectivity). Always use `$.pump(Duration(...))`.
2. **Tap fields before `enterText`** — flutter_animate delays EditableText creation. Tap to focus first.
3. **`ensureVisible` before tapping** off-screen buttons.
4. **Extra pump after navigation** — `$.pump(Duration(seconds: 2))` for flutter_animate animations on destination page.
5. **Unique data per test** — timestamps in emails/names to avoid H2 collisions.
6. **`gradlew --stop`** before each run — prevents Gradle lock file issues.
7. **NEVER `Stop-Process -Name java`** — kills the backend along with Gradle.

## How to Run

```powershell
# From worship_hub_ui/ directory
# Prerequisites: backend running with H2, emulator running

$env:PATH = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Pub\Cache\bin;$env:PATH"
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"
$env:PATH = "$env:ANDROID_HOME\platform-tools;$env:PATH"

# IMPORTANT: Clean before each run
.\android\gradlew.bat --stop
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "build\app\outputs\androidTest-results" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "build\app\reports\androidTests" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Run one file at a time
patrol test -t integration_test/tests/auth/login_test.dart -d emulator-5554
```

## Priority for Next Session

1. **MIGRATE TO PATROL 4.x + WEB** (top priority)
   - Upgrade `patrol: 3.20.0` → `patrol: ^4.1.0` in pubspec.yaml
   - Upgrade `patrol_cli: 3.11.0` → `patrol_cli: 4.3.1` globally
   - Install Playwright: `npx playwright install`
   - Update `TestConfig.baseUrl` to use `localhost:9090` (no more `10.0.2.2`)
   - Migrate `patrolTest` syntax to Patrol 4.x API (check migration guide)
   - Run tests with `patrol test -d chrome`
   - This eliminates: Android orchestrator hangs, Gradle lock files, emulator dependency, `10.0.2.2` mapping
   - Migration guide: https://www.mintlify.com/leancodepl/patrol/migration/v3-to-v4

2. **Fix NavigationHelper** after migration (may resolve itself with web)
3. **Fix invitation tests** — add `seedHelper.login()` only where needed
4. **Fix remaining test failures** with faster feedback loop (web is instant vs 5min Android builds)
5. **Add missing tests** — song_search_filter (2 missing), complete coverage
